# Activities
Suggesting some fun things to do for when you're bored

## How to use
Check out the code and start server and client separately. Both can be started with the command 'npm run start'. Server runs on localhost:3000, client on localhost:4200. Prerequisites are the usual. Make sure you can run Node.js and Angular projects locally and don't forget to run 'npm install' to get all dependencies!

## What to do
For the server, have a look at the swagger documentation under localhost:3000/docs. 
The client is pretty self-explanatory. Request activities under the activity-tab, update the current user under the user-tab.
